Running `define-git-lol` once, as yourself, defines the `git lol` alias, globally.
This makes `git lol` available to all your projects, for this and for future sessions.

Installing `git-addfile` and `git-scratch` somewhere in your path,
makes `addfile` and `scratch` into new, Git subcommands.
For example,

```
mv git-* ~/bin/
git scratch       # notice, no "-" between "git" and "scratch".
```
